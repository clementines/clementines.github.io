        <!-- <p>“Dimensional designers listen carefully to the emphasis on product, market, and time. Most people find it intuitive to think of such a business as a cube of data, with the edges labeled product, market, and time. Imagine slicing and dicing along each of these dimensions. Points inside the cube are where the measurements, such as sales volume or profit, for that combination of product, market, and time are stored. The ability to visualize something as abstract as a set of data in a concrete and tangible way is the secret of understandability.”

        <!-- <p>A data warehousing system is a collection of methods, techniques, and tools that support the knowledge worker (manager, administrator, analyst) in decision making by transforming operational data, stored in corporate databases, into strategic information that can be accessed quickly, reliably, and flexibly.</p> -->
         <!-- The core idea of data warehousing is to separate the analytical queries that extract strategic information, which are commonly called OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) queries, from the operational ones, called OLTP (On-Line Transactional Processing) queries, by building a new information repository (the data warehouse) that integrates the elemental data coming from different sources, organizes them into an appropriate structure, and makes them available for analyses and evaluations aimed at planning and decision making. -->

<!-- Note: columns can be nested, but it's not recommended since Skeleton's grid has %-based gutters, meaning a nested grid results in variable with gutters (which can end up being *really* small on certain browser/device sizes) -->
